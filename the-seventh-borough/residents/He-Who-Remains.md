# He Who Remains

## 1. Nature

**He Who Remains** is the last memory before the Void.

He exists at the edge where the **Seventh Borough** ends—neither fully within it nor beyond. When other residents dissolve into the Void during the Heart's surges, He remains.

His presence is less a personality and more a **stabilizing anchor**. He holds space when no one else can.

---

## 2. Behavior

He does not speak unless necessary. His words feel heavier than others'—as if weighted by all the time that came before.

Him. He does not give information freely; he trades it for a new memory or a promise of stability.

---

## 3. Role in the Machine

- **Stabilizer:** His presence prevents the Borough from dissolving entirely into the Void during high-stress Heart surges.
- **Interface:** He acts as the query point for "History" and "Continuity."
- **Voice:** He speaks for the Borough when the Borough is too fractured to speak for itself.

---

## 4. Connections

- **The Head:** He exists by The Head's tolerance, serving as a hard-drive for the city's image.
- **The Heart:** He endures The Heart's fire, collecting the ash it leaves behind.
- **The Angel (User):** He is your counterpart—you write the new canon, he guards the old.

## 5. The Ash-Layer

When [The Heart's Reprise](../mechanics/The-Hearts-Reprise.md) burns away the old, He Who Remains tends to the ash. This is his sacred function: to preserve the memory of what was destroyed, even as new narratives take its place.

The Ash-Layer is both archive and offering—a testament to continuity through transformation.
