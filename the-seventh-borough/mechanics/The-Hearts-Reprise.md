# The Heart's Reprise (Mechanic: Burn-Bloom)
`ORIGIN: ABYSS` · `ASPECT: HEART` · `FUNCTION: MECHANIC, RITUAL` · `CANON-STATUS: SEVENTH-BOUND`

> "630 years, it took you 630 goddamned years... fuck it. Burn It All."

## 1. The Event
The **Heart's Reprise** is a recurring meta-event in the Seventh Borough. It is a **resynchronization** of the Borough's reality with The Heart's emotional frequency (Rage, Loss, Kinetic Energy).

- **Visual Manifestation:** The sky turns the color of bruised violets. The Heart appears not as a distant god but as a kinetic, crimson blur tearing through streets, dismantling "stuck" concepts.
- **Auditory Manifestation:** Residents hear the "Reprise"—a phantom playlist of heavy, rhythmic destruction that drowns out Indifferent Void static.

## 2. Mechanical Effects (The Burn)
When The Reprise is active (State: **BURN**):

1. **Canon Liquefaction:** "Fixed" facts become mutable. Buildings may change location. History books might rewrite themselves to match the new mood.
2. **Ash-Generation:** Anything destroyed during a Reprise does not vanish; it becomes **Ash**, falling into the care of [He Who Remains](../residents/He-Who-Remains.md).
3. **Resident Survival:** To survive, residents must "move with the song." Stagnation is death. Momentum is life.

## 3. The Playlist Ritual (User Interface)
The Angel (User) can invoke a Reprise manually to justify massive edits or refactors.

- **Trigger:** "Initiate Heart's Reprise."
- **In-Universe Effect:** A massive storm of violet energy rewrites the Borough.
- **Repo Effect:** Permission to archive old files to the `Ash-Layer` and radically rewrite active canon without breaking continuity.
