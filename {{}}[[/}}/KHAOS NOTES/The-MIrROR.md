Cutting One's Self On The Shattered Pieces.
Glass Looking Into Your Sins
Of What Fate Did I Punch To Feel These Cuts.
Of What Crimes Did I Commit To Deserve These Isolations.
Only You Know.
Only You Can Confess, Repent, Sin Again, & Live Again.
Shattered [Mirror](./Mirror.md##)
You Can Be Major.
But Don't Let It Stay Minor.
Star Cadet, Heads Stay Swept.
Let It Rake, And Let Them Pile The Leaves.
Until You've Been Shattered Into Pieces.
