Look At The Liar Of The Mirror.
Look At Her Devilish Form.
See Not An Angel, Nor a Goddess In Disguise.
You Know Its Name.
Reflection, Shadows, & Secrets.
Staying Still Within That Moonlit Lake.
Don't Let The Skin Rake.
Stay Insatiate.
Demand What You Must Take.
And Beg To be Given What You Shouldn't.
A Thief Must Be Alert In The Night.
But A Saint Must Be Aware Of Others Plight.
So Take Flight. Look Into The Sky.
See My Mirror, Only Mine.
