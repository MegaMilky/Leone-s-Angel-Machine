## Chapter 3: The Essence of the Qualitative Approach

### Core Definition
- **Qualitative seeks to UNDERSTAND** phenomena (vs quantitative: EXPLAIN)
- **Emic approach**: Describes world as experienced by people in everyday life
- **Micro-analytic** and focused on specific problems/situations

### Three Foundational Dimensions

#### 1. Ontology (Understanding Reality)
- People actively **'construct'** individual realities from experiences
- Reality **differs person to person**
- Reality is **socially constructed** through interactions
- People are **'actors'** not passive **'subjects'**

#### 2. Epistemology (Types of Questions)
- How do people make sense of the external world?
- How do they understand their place in it?
- How do they decide how to act?
- How do they communicate understandings?

#### 3. Methodology (Research Procedures)
- **OBSERVING** in real-life settings or eliciting descriptions
- **RECORDING** narratives (usually verbal)
- **INTERPRETING** using discipline concepts
- **GENERALIZING** to other people/settings/theory

### Qualitative vs Quantitative Contrast

| Aspect | Quantitative (Positivism) | Qualitative |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Properties** | Clearly defined and measurable | Discovers how people see world |
| **Approach** | Same form in all people | Researcher-respondent cooperation |
| **Data** | Expressed numerically | Narrative-based |
| **Logic** | Tests existing laws (deductive) | Infers hypotheses from data (inductive) |
| **Researcher Role** | Objective observer | Collaborative partner |

### Five Basic Principles
1. **Research Question**: Investigate **'Why?' 'How?' 'What kind?'** not just 'How much?'
2. **Philosophy**: Focus on direct everyday experience, **inductive process**
3. **Method**: Elicit **narratives** (interviews dominant)
4. **Roles**: Participants as **partners**, not subjects
5. **Data Analysis**: Interpret **meaning** of narratives

### Key Properties

#### Orientation Focus
- **Discovery** over confirmation
- **Broadly defined goals**
- **Open research questions** (may change)
- **Emergent content themes**
- **Generation of hypotheses**
- **Credibility** as criterion

#### Design Characteristics
- **Non-experimental**, descriptive
- Resembles **everyday life** (external validity priority)
- Usually **ex-post-facto** designs
- **Openness**: can start without theory
- Topics can **'emerge'** during research

### Validity in Qualitative Research (7 Phases)

| Phase | Criterion |
|-------|-----------|
| **Thematising** | Sound reasoning for research question |
| **Designing** | Clear explanation of thinking |
| **Collecting data** | Quality of questioning and checking |
| **Transcribing** | Accuracy of recording |
| **Interpreting** | Logic of interpretation |
| **Reporting** | Accuracy of account |
| **Verifying** | Credibility and usefulness |

### Researcher Qualifications Required
- **Special knowledge** of field and concepts
- **Inductive thinking** ability
- **Personality**: empathy, openness, adaptability, trust-inspiring
- **Good judgment** with people
- **Strong ethical attitude**
- **Tolerance for uncertainty**

### Three-Phase Relationship Model

| Phase | Process | Purpose | Action | Result |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Qualitative** | Induction | Description/Explanation | Observation | General properties, explanation |
| **Transfer** | Application | Switch modes | Work out implications | Formulate hypotheses |
| **Quantitative** | Deduction | Test hypotheses | Inferential statistics | Confirm/Disconfirm/Revise |

## Chapter 7: Analyzing Qualitative Data

### Core Purpose
- **CONTENT ANALYSIS** most common approach
- **Goal**: Discover general abstract **MEANING** underlying related statements
- Achieve **PARSIMONY**: reduce data to smallest number of broad dimensions

### Essential Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Coding** | Identifying understandable, concrete, specific, relevant statements |
| **Content unit** | Single word/small group containing single specific idea |
| **Deconstruction** | Breaking narrative into small specific statements |
| **Reconstruction** | Re-combining statements into broad general statements |
| **Emergent issue** | Topic introduced by respondents, not researcher |
| **Convergence** | Point where new narratives yield no new ideas |
| **Parsimony** | Reduction with least information loss |
| **Tabula rasa** | Starting without imposing structure a priori |

### Reliability and Validity Criteria

#### Reliability
- **Stability**: Procedure reproducible by another researcher
- **Confirmability**: Another researcher would get similar results

#### Internal Validity
- **Accuracy**: Representations not distorted
- **Truthfulness**: Not biased by researcher preconceptions

#### External Validity
- **Credibility**: Findings make sense to knowledgeable observers
- **Usefulness**: Practical implications spelled out realistically

### Two Major Analysis Approaches

#### 1. HOLISTIC-INTUITIVE
- Read **entire text repeatedly**
- Develop **interpretation of whole**
- **Revise** with each new text
- Continue until **convergence**
- More subjective, **'felt' interpretations**

#### 2. ATOMISTIC-LOGICAL
- Break text into **content units** (small statements)
- Identify units by **logical rules**
- **Combine** units into categories
- **Build** categories into concepts
- More **systematic and objective**

### Analysis Process Options

#### Inductive Approach
1. Start **WITHOUT** pre-existing expectations
2. Let themes **'emerge'** from data
3. Read 2-3 protocols to identify themes
4. **Return** to earlier protocols to check themes
5. **Continue** with additional protocols

#### Deductive Approach
1. Start **WITH** focused expectations (from theory)
2. General principle **already exists**
3. Examine **how** phenomenon manifests in this group
4. Look at **forms, roles, interactions**

### Preliminary Steps

#### 1. Summarizing
Eliminate irrelevant material:
- Hesitations ("ah," "you know")
- Repetitions
- False starts
- Abandoned statements

#### 2. Clarifying
- Restate to make meaning **unambiguous**
- Don't change respondent's meaning
- Turn slang into standard language
- Use context to resolve unclear terms

### Finding Content Units - Guidelines
- **Need not** be complete sentences
- Usually **brief** (1-4 words, max 7-8)
- Focus on **specific and concrete** statements
- **Eliminate** meaningless, repetitious, irrelevant material
- **Don't over-interpret** - stay with what's actually stated
- Be **conscious** of exclusion reasons

### Major Analytic Methods

#### ANALYTIC INDUCTION (Holistic-Intuitive)

**Steps:**
1. **Identify** problem/object of study
2. **Collect** data (interviews, narratives)
3. **Read carefully**, immerse in protocol
4. **Form** working hypothesis
5. **Read** further narratives
6. **Examine** fit with hypothesis
7. **Revise** hypothesis when discrepancies occur
8. **Repeat** until no revision needed
9. **Latest version** becomes finding

**Characteristics:**
- Uses **negative cases** for refinement
- **Hypothesis emerges** during process
- Data collection and analysis **alternate**

#### GROUNDED THEORY (Atomistic-Logical)

**Steps:**
1. **Identify** problem/object of study
2. **Collect** data
3. **Break** text into content units
4. **Combine** units into **CATEGORIES**
5. **Clarify/saturate** categories
6. **Build** overarching **CONCEPTS** from categories
7. **Look for connections**, formulate theories
8. **Link** to existing theories

**Key Features:**
- Theory is **'grounded'** in data
- More **rigorous and systematic**
- Uses **Method of Constant Comparisons**

#### Method of Constant Comparisons
- Analyze **cases one at a time**
- **Compare** each new case with existing analysis
- **Continue** until no changes occur

### Other Analysis Approaches

#### Hermeneutic Analysis
- Like **literary analysis**
- Must display: **coherence, comprehensiveness, penetration, contextuality**
- Consider **totality** of text
- Researcher aware of **own biases**
- Focus on **narrative sequence**

#### Critical Incidents Analysis
- Identify **specific significant incidents**
- Must be **concrete, personally experienced**
- Can be **turning points** in life
- Can define incidents **in advance** or let **emerge**

#### Framework Analysis
- **Atomistic-logical** approach
- **Themes/topics** as broadest categories
- Present as **matrix** (rows=participants, columns=subtopics)

#### Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)
- Explores **PERSONAL EXPERIENCE** of state/event
- Used in **health, clinical, social psychology**
- What does experience **'feel like'**?
- **Semi-structured interviews** common

### Role of Theory

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tabula Rasa** | No pre-existing structure, discover emergent issues |
| **Theory-Guided** | Use existing theory or researcher's intuitive theory |
| **Sensitizing Concepts** | Theory emerges during analysis, then sensitizes researcher |

### Computer-Assisted Analysis

#### Available Tools
- **AQUAD 7**, GABEK/WinRelan, MAXQDA
- NUD.IST, Ethnograph, Atlas/ti, NVivo

#### Advantages
- Faster coding
- Better overview of relationships
- More differentiated insights
- Formal structure for rules

#### Limitations
- **Cannot replace** insight and intuition
- Cannot recognize **unexpected associations**
- Cannot understand **private figures of speech**
- Risk of **losing authenticity**

**Key Point**: ***Software cannot do the thinking for you***

### Important Analysis Principles
- **Subjective but NOT arbitrary** - systematic and reproducible
- **Dynamic**: interaction between researcher and data
- Focus on **GENERAL dimensions**, not clinical diagnosis
- Use **discipline-based concepts** and formal scientific terms
- Analysis is **NOT a clinical procedure**
- Look for dimensions applicable to **multiple respondents**

### Completing Analysis - Final Steps
1. **DESCRIBE** how object of study is understood using concepts as framework
2. **INTERPRET** relationship using concepts as framework
3. **GENERALIZE** beyond particular individuals (substantive theory)
4. **FORMALIZE** connection to relevant theory (formal theory)
5. **APPLY** to concrete practical problems (usefulness)
