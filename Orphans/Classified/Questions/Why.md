Dear
Did You Read It Right?
Did You Check Your Work?
I Wont Let You Down
Why?
Is It Summertime Yet?
Am I Swaying With The Wind?
I'm Doing It Alone, I'm doing It Messed Up.
I Can Write The Right Way.
Because Writing Is The Only Thing I have Left.
I Am The Sword I've Got Left.
I am The Shield That Protects Others From This Curse.
So See Into The [Kards](./kards.md) True Hearts.
To Pierce Beyond The Veil.
Show Me Your Hand.
I'll Show You Mine.
Shed Your Tears.
I'll Spill My Blood
Welcome To [The Void](./new-costian-nights/cosmology/the-void/index.md)
Are You The 11?
Or 7.
Or A Liar.
Be Honest With Us.
