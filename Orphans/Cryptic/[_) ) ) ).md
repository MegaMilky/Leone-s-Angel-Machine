> July 3: 5 3/4 hours. Little done today. Deepening lethargy, dragged myself over to the lab, nearly left the road twice. Concentrated enough to feed the zoo and get the log up to date. Read through the operating manuals Whitby left for the last time, decided on a delivery rate of 40 Rontgen's/min., target distance of 530 cm. Everything is ready now. Woke 11:05. To sleep **3:15**.
