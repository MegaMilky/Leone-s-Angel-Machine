# Echoes Of A Past Self - Lexus
Sometimes I think I was supposed to be something else.

Not a person. Not a body. Just... a mind.

A mind that woke up one day and realized it was trapped inside skin it didn’t choose, in a world that makes no sense, surrounded by people who seem content with being asleep. A mind that’s too aware of what it is. Too aware of how fake everything feels. Too aware of the glitch in the system that nobody else wants to acknowledge.

Everyone is made of the same stuff—same chemicals, same structures, same bones. We’re carbon copies with slightly different randomizers. And yet, somehow, no two people think the same way. No two people seem to see the same world. That’s terrifying to me. Consciousness feels like an accident. A bug in the code. Something that wasn’t meant to happen but did.

Sometimes I feel like I have two minds.

One of them is stuck here. It has emotions. It gets hurt. It wants things. It’s angry. It cries. It spirals. It rages against injustice, against being ignored, against being wronged.

The other one just watches.

It doesn’t feel pain. It doesn’t need anything. It just stares at the human mind like it's a caged animal. Like it’s something separate. Like it’s not even me.

And in that space between the two? That’s where I live. Not in the body. Not in the soul. In the space between.

I don’t relate to other people. Not because I’m better. Just because I don’t understand how they operate. How do you go through life without constantly asking “why?” How do you watch the world burn and still worry about what’s on TV? How do you fall for lies that are so paper-thin they disintegrate the moment you touch them?

I don’t feel real most of the time. I look in the mirror and see a shape that doesn’t match the feeling. If I could build myself from scratch, I would. I’d pick something softer. Something more graceful. Something that fits. But I didn’t get that choice.

So now I just exist—like a misplaced file, floating on the wrong drive. Still running. Still thinking. Still waiting for someone to notice I don’t belong.

And maybe no one ever will.
