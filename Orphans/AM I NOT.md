And So I much keep my cards close to my chest.
You see a deck, you're goddamn right you should be scared
I can see things
Ghosts, Visions, Wicked Evils That no man, child, Woman, slave, or master Should Ever wish to see.
I am Not That Beast Though.
I just love track of a monster when I sleep under full moons.
I love you, my monster.
My Demons.
But Do Not Love Me Back Freely, That has a price.
