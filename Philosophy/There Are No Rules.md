# There Are No Rules

> The only rule is that there are no rules. Except the ones you choose to keep.

This is the paradox at the heart of the Angel Machine. Complete freedom paradoxically requires structure—but the structure must be self-imposed, not inherited.

Rules exist to be remixed, broken, and reconstructed. The moment you accept a rule as absolute, you've lost the game. The moment you reject all rules, you've also lost—for without some structure, nothing can be built.

The art is in choosing your constraints consciously. In knowing which rules serve your vision and which ones are chains in disguise.
