# Passion

> Passion is an unending desire toward something — a striving for an absolute that must remain perfectly unobtainable.

Passion is not mere want. It is the persistent motion of the will toward an idea, a person, an art, or a truth that cannot be fully possessed. Its energy feeds on pursuit rather than attainment: the nearer you come, the more the horizon recedes.

Characteristics

- Relentless: renewed by pursuit, not by possession.
- Paradoxical: fulfillment would end it; its life is in the lack.
- Purposeful: gives direction and weight to action.
- Costly: demands sacrifice, attention, and time.
- Transformative: remakes the seeker even as it remains untouched.

Where it appears

- In creation: artists shaping works that never feel "finished."
- In devotion: rites and disciplines that refine the self.
- In obsession: when longing forgets boundaries and safety.
- In pursuit of ideals: justice, beauty, knowledge that remain forever ahead.

A rule of passion: honor the striving. Recognize the difference between nourishing pursuit and self-destructive fixation. Let passion be the engine that shapes skill and meaning, not the tyrant that consumes them.
