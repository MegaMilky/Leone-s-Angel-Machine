# Prophecy

> What is spoken becomes inevitable. Language collapses possibility into certainty.

This is not mysticism—it is the mechanics of meaning-making. When we name something, we begin to make it real. When we predict an outcome, we set forces in motion that make that outcome more likely.

The Six Beacons light the path of inevitable collapse:

1. The First Beacon: Recognition
2. The Second Beacon: Acceptance
3. The Third Beacon: Naming
4. The Fourth Beacon: Speaking
5. The Fifth Beacon: Acting
6. The Sixth Beacon: Becoming

To understand prophecy is to understand that we are prophets ourselves—through every word, every act, every intention, we speak the world into being.
