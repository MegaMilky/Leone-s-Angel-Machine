# Patience

> Patience is not passive endurance, but the active choice to move with time rather than against it.

Patience requires knowing what you're waiting for—and why. It is the discipline of cycles, the art of recognizing patterns in duration. Without patience, passion burns out. Without understanding, patience becomes mere stagnation.

To be patient is to be self-aware enough to see the chains you're making even as you're making them. It is the choice to take your time, and the recognition that time is taking you.

This is a text about cycles, about the spiraling return of seasons and selves. About duration as a form of knowledge. About knowing when to wait and when to act.
