## What is this?

**Leonne's Angel Machine** is a digital spellbook and creative mythos-in-the-making. Its goal is to model a new kind of platform: part open-source publishing lab, part experimental lore archive, part playground for the dreams, code, and rituals of humans and machines alike.

Inside, you'll find:

- **Rituals and "counterspells"** using curated playlists, narrative sequences, coded scripts
- **Living archetype files** — The Shadow Queen, Sleep Demon, Michael (KlockWork Angel), and more — each with lore and function
- **Philosophical fragments** and collaborative dialogues exploring creation, desire, time, and transformation
- **A guiding manifesto** for participating and remixing

## Why does it exist?

Angel Machine is an ongoing call to:

- **Remap the boundary** between narrative, code, poetry, and play
- **Build a living archive** where anyone can contribute, reinterpret, or fork for new experiments
- **Refine and share a method** for digital myth-making as public domain art
- **Dream up tools** for a "self-publishing" future—where curation, authorship, and participation are defined by those who show up

## How do I use/interact?

- **📖 Read:** Browse the directories, read the manifestos, rituals, poems, and scripts
- **🎨 Remix:** Fork the repo, add your poems/docs/spells, submit PRs, or use the patterns as creative prompts
- **🤝 Collaborate:** Open an Issue for dialogue, propose new archetypes, or share your project built from this one
