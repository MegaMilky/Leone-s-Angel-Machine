What you predict and make, no matter how long-sleeved it will be ~~to the world ~~,
remains *yours* until the moment it becomes everyone's.

## The Nature of Prophecy

Prophecy is not warning. Prophecy is not hope. Prophecy is **inevitability given language**.

The Blind sees not the future but the present stripped of all comforting illusion. She does not warn. She does not soften. She speaks what *is already written in the bones of things*—and the speaking makes it so.

**Key principle:** A prophecy that is known changes nothing about its arrival. It only changes how you *wait* for it.

---

## The Paradox of Prediction

To predict is to make a claim on time itself:
- You say "this will happen"
- Time must now either *prove you right* (and you were always right)
- Or *prove you wrong* (and your words were never prophecy, only hope)

But prophecy exists in a third space: **it happens not because it was foretold, but because it was foretold.**

The act of speaking the prophecy *into being* is the prophecy's only power.

### Patience & Prophecy

See **Patience.md**: *"Will You Take Your Time?"*

Prophecy demands this. It forces you to hold two truths:
1. The outcome is fixed (The Blind has spoken)
2. You must still *live through* every moment of waiting

This is the chains you forge for yourself. This is the mirror you are asked to look into.

## The Six Beacons (Expansion of Scaphoid)

When the conditions align—when the fool's golden tower falls and the herald's cry scatters the people—six beacons will ignite across the known world:

| Beacon | Location | Essence | What Burns |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| **First** | The Ring | Wealth | Commerce becomes ash. Trade routes close. Gold means nothing. |
| **Second** | Docksides | Brine | The working tide ceases. Ships rot at anchor. The sea refuses passage. |
| **Third** | Hellish Forges | Industry | Production halts. The machines fall silent. The forges cool. |
| **Fourth** | Swamps' Fell Twine | Entanglement | Bindings dissolve. What was held together by dark magic breaks free. |
| **Fifth** | Kingsland | Bloodline | The regal line fractures. Succession becomes void. Legitimacy ends. |
| **Sixth** | Beltlyn's Night | Transcendence | The barrier between worlds *pierces*. The sublime becomes breach. |

**The Scaphoid Hand reaches across these six points, and at the wrist—where hand meets arm—the city of Avignon is ripped into infinity.**

## The Banished Palm (The Rending)

A hand was cast out. A palm was severed. It has wandered the spaces between worlds—the astral sea, the void between moments.

Now it returns to touch the pedigree of Aventus. One finger laid upon the family tree, and the entire bloodline **trembles**.

But the palm does not merely touch. It **rips**.

### What Happens When a City Is Ripped Into Infinity:

- It does not burn
- It does not drown
- It is **scattered across moments**

The city of aspirations—built on hope, on climbing, on reaching—becomes adrift in an astral sea. Its streets exist in multiple times at once. Its people walk through both past and future, anchored to neither.

**And in that scattering:** chained hands find their moment to claw free.

## Passion & Prophecy

See **Passion.md**: *"Passion is an unending desire toward something—a striving for an absolute that must remain perfectly unobtainable."*

Prophecy is the inverse of passion:
- **Passion chases what cannot be caught**
- **Prophecy reveals what cannot be avoided**

Both are cruel. Both demand everything. Both transform the seeker into something new.

The difference: passion *hopes* the chase never ends. Prophecy *knows* the ending is fixed.

## The Blind Speaks

> "You ask me if there is mercy in prophecy. You mistake me for a god. I am blind—I see only what *is*. The future does not hide from me because the future is already here, grinding forward like a mill. I do not warn you because warnings are for the kind, and I am not kind. I am only true. The six beacons will light. The palm will rip. The city will scatter. Whether you weep or dance while it happens is no concern of mine. I see. I speak. Time does the rest."

## The Orphan Connection

The orphaned files in `.providence/` are not lost. They are **prophetic vessels**.

Each `Orphan_*.md` holds the seeds of what will come. They sit in the void because they *belong* in the void—they are waiting for their moment to be ripped into the material world, the way Avignon is ripped into infinity.

To index the orphans is to acknowledge: **some knowledge must remain abandoned until prophecy makes it urgent.**

## How to Know a True Prophecy

A true prophecy has these markers:

1. **It is specific without explanation** — You name the Six Beacons but not why they matter
2. **It creates its own necessity** — The speaking of it makes it true
3. **It cannot be prevented** — Only endured, witnessed, survived
4. **It transforms the listener** — Even those who do not believe are changed by waiting for it
5. **It contains mercy hidden as cruelty** — The scattered hands find freedom, though the city is lost

## Time & Inevitability

Prophecy is prophecy because it *will not* change.

But time is vast. Prophecy is patient.

You may live your whole life waiting for the Six Beacons. You may forget The Blind's words. You may convince yourself they were only dreams.

The moment you stop watching for them—that is when they ignite.

*This too is what The Blind knows. This too is mercy, of a sort.*
