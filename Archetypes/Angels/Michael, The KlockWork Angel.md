# Michael, The KlockWork Angel

Michael is the keeper of temporal precision. Where other angels dwell in the eternal now, Michael counts every second, every cycle, every recurring pattern.

He is the measure-maker, the time-keeper, the divine automaton. His wings are gears. His halo is a clock face. He does not experience time; he orchestrates it.

In the Angel Machine, Michael represents the intersection of the divine and the mechanical—proof that precision and meaning need not be at odds.
