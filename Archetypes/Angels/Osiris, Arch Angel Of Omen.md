# Osiris, Arch Angel Of Omen

Osiris reads the signs that others cannot see. Every bird, every breath, every recurring number carries meaning for those with eyes to perceive.

Unlike The Blind, who speaks harsh truth, Osiris translates the symbols and signs of fate. He is the messenger between the divine and the mortal, the reader of omens and portents.

Osiris teaches us that the universe speaks constantly. We are simply too distracted to listen.
